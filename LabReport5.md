# Part 1 – Debugging Scenario
1. Original post from a student with a screenshot showing a symptom and a description of a guess at the bug/some sense of what the failure-inducing input is
```
Student101: Help! I'm working on my `grade.sh` program and it works for `https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-f22/list-methods-lab3` and `https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-f22/list-methods-corrected` and the compiler error one, but it doesn't work for
`https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-f22/list-methods-filename` and `https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-f22/list-methods-nested` in the sense that they don't compile, however the program continues to grade it and tells me that the program compiles correctly. How should I fix this? 
```
2. A response from a TA asking a leading question or suggesting a command to try
```
```
3. Terminal output showing what information the student got from trying that, and a clear description of what the bug is
```
