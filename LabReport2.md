**1. Which methods in your code are called?** <br>
When the server is intialized the 'main' and 'Server.start'method are called. Once the server is opened up and the user inputs a valid user and message input into the URL bar, the 'handleRequest' method is called.<br>
**2. What are the relevant arguments to those methods, and the values of any relevant fields of the class?** <br>
Relevant arguments used in those methods include the <br>
**3. How do the values of any relevant fields of the class change from this specific request? If no values got changed, explain why.** <br> 
When the server <br>
   * 'user' value: '"zrios"'
   * 'message' value: '"Hello"'

**1. Which methods in your code are called?** <br>
The 'handleRequest' method is called due to a change of input in the URL bar. Addtionally, the 'main and 'Server.start' methods won't run because the server has already been intialized. <br>
**2. What are the relevant arguments to those methods, and the values of any relevant fields of the class?** <br>
Relevant arguments used in those methods include the <br>
**3. How do the values of any relevant fields of the class change from this specific request? If no values got changed, explain why.** <br> 
When the server <br>
   * 'user' value: '"zrios"'

* The absolute path to the public key is '/home/linux/ieng6/oce/2l/zrios/.ssh/id_rsa'

**The absolute path to the public key for your SSH key for logging into ieng6 (this is the one you copied to your account on ieng6, so it should be a path on ieng6's file system)**

* The absolute path to the public key is '/home/linux/ieng6/oce/2l/zrios/.ssh/id_rsa.pub'

**A terminal interaction where you log into your ieng6 account without being asked for a password.**

```
* Completed by running ssh-keygen -t rsa in terminal, enter no passphrase,  

- I'm not really sure what they want me to show 

## Part 3
In the past two weeks, I've learned how to operate ssh on my local machine, how to open up servers, and how to use URL Handler. Noteably, I found opening up a server to be the most challeneging. However, after doing this lap report, I find it easier to navigate and understanding the componenets of the URL such as the protocal, domain, port number, path, query string separator, and the query string.
